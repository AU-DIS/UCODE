# UCoDe: Unified Community Detection with Graph Convolutional Networks

Implementation of UCoDe for overlapping and non-overlapping community detection as proposed in the paper:

This implementation is written in Python 3.

# Requirements
<ul>
  <li>networkx==2.6.3</li>
  <li>networkx==2.6.3</li>
  <li>numpy==1.20.3</li>
  <li>pandas==1.4.0<\li>
  <li>Pillow==9.3.0<\li>
  <li>scikit-learn==1.0.1<\li>
  <li>scipy==1.7.3<\li>
  <li>six==1.16.0<\li>
  <li>torch==1.10.0<\li>
</ul>

# Installation
    
You can install all the required packages using the following command:

$conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

# Run the code

Run main.py for an example result of non-overlapping community detection.
Run mainOUCODE.py for an example result of overlapping community detection.
